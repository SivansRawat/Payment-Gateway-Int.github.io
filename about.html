                        Charitable organizations, also known as nonprofits, operate for the benefit of society and are exempt from paying income tax on the donations and funds they receive. These organizations are typically founded with a specific social cause or mission in mind, and work towards achieving their goals through a variety of programs and initiatives. Nonprofits can encompass a wide range of areas, such as education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and more. They rely on the support of donors, volunteers, and the community to carry out their work and make a positive impact on society. As public extensions of a nation's revenue department, nonprofits are held accountable for their actions and must maintain transparency and integrity in their operations.
